Hello 👋, I'm Sagar, a passionate Computer Science Engineer 🧑‍💻, Senior Software Developer at [North Loop](https://www.nolobank.com/) and a Tech Educator at [SOAL](https://www.schoolofacceleratedlearning.com/)
 based in Goa, India 🇮🇳. I mainly work with JavaScript/Node.js and other JS frameworks.

I am passionate about Tech, problem solving through code & self learning 💪. 

I always strive to challenge my skills to improve what I do.

In my free time I enjoy Family Guy, Total War and football ⚽. I'm also a dad to a Golden Retriever 🦮.
