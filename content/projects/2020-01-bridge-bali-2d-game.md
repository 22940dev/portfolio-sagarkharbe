Bridge is an in-browser, 2D platformer game where you walk on walls and build **bridges to collect** all of Bali's lost tools.

Featuring seamless **gravity switching**, a powerful and easy-to-use **level editor**, and a community of other builders, Bridge Bali provides unlimited entertainment. Play your friends levels, then once you master the mechanics, make your own to share with friends. Engage in a social network inspired by Mario Maker and work your way to the #1 slot on the **Top Creator rankings**, or play mind-bending stages and experience a new dimension of construction.

Advanced features include **OAuth** with **Google, "**forking**" levels to put your own spin on them,** server-side screenshot generation\*\*, and a Bali's Ghost that will play back your movements from a previous run.

Currently due to bug fixings and maintenance, the game is not available for preview, but source it linked above. It will be **live again** soon I promise!
