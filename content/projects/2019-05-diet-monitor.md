EasyCal is a modern calorie counting app that makes nutrition tracking easy:

* Add foods to your daily log, differentiated by meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
* Easily find frequent foods by browsing recent foods list
* Create custom foods
* View food log for any day of your choosing using the date navigator on the home page
* Modify serving sizes of foods in your log
* Remove foods from your log
* Enter calories burned from exercise each day
* Set daily calorie and nutrient goals, see progress towards those goals in the daily log
* View nutrition breakdowns for any date range: total and average macro and micro nutrients
* See a graph of food consumption and exercise over time

If you'd like to start counting your calories and tracking your exercise, you can register an account with just an email address and password! To take it for a test run, try registering for the app.
